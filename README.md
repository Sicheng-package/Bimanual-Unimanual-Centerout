**Introduction**  
This repository provides MATLAB-based code for the center-out task, supporting both unimanual (single-hand) and bimanual (two-hand) paradigms.The task was designed for rhesus monkeys using joysticks to control on-screen cursors and reach targets.

**Requirements**  
1.Use based Joysticks   
2.two computers with Matlab（MATLAB R2022a or later）  
3.NI 6009（external DAQ hardware for TTL signal recording）  
4.Ethernet cable or LAN connection for TCP communication
